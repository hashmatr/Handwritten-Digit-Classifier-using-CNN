# Handwritten-Digit-Classifier-using-CNN
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in PyTorch to recognize handwritten digits (0–9) from images, similar to the MNIST dataset. The CNN automatically extracts features from input images using convolutional and pooling layers, and predicts the digit using fully connected layers.
